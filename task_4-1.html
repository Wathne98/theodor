    <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Object-oriented development allows for code reusability, modular design, and encapsulation, making it easier to manage and maintain complex systems. By modeling real-world entities as classes, it also helps create more intuitive and organized code structures.</p>

      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>The static object `AccountType` provides a single source of truth for different account types. This makes code more readable and avoids hardcoding values, which improves maintainability by allowing updates in one place.</p>

      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Encapsulation helps control access to data within a class and prevents unintended interference. Private members (using `#`) are hidden from outside access, while public methods provide controlled access, ensuring the internal state remains consistent and protected.</p>

      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>The `new` command creates an instance of a class, allocating memory and setting `this` to refer to the new instance, allowing properties and methods to be applied to that specific object.</p>
